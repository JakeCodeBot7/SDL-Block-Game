# SDL-Block-Game

A school project developed by me and my friends Andirija, Jurgen, and Gary. Built using SDL3, it's a fast-paced, multiplayer block-breaking game where players compete in real time. Features include audio, input feedback, a scoring timer, and a simple server based multiplayer setup, whoever scores highest wins.
